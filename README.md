## About Me

Hi, I’m **Giwa Reagan Iziomo** - an engineer and data scientist passionate about building intelligent systems that connect research, automation, and real-world operations.  

I'm currently **Head of AI and Automation** in manufacturing, leading a high-performing team to develop data-driven solutions for yield optimisation, robotics integration, computer vision, and digital twins. My projects cover commercial, financial and operational research analytics. And I post here a few of my independent projects. Ultimately, I'm focused on applying machine learning and mathematical modelling to translate process data into actionable insights and autonomous decision systems.

I am deeply engaged in research and advanced study, having recently completed a 2-year Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) funded by Innovate UK, executing a business-wide data science project through a collaboration between academia and industry. I presented work from this project at the prestigious 33rd European Conference on Operational Research (EURO 2024) in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the Operational Research Society Annual Conference (OR66) in Bangor, Wales. My research explores topics such as explainable AI, predictive digital twins, multi-sensory AI, and human-inspired decision systems. I am currently preparing manuscripts for publication, focusing on AI systems that blend human reasoning with data-intensive modelling in novel contexts.

On this GitHub, you’ll find:
- Applied **machine learning and optimisation models** (e.g., yield prediction, logistics optimisation, group allocation, anomaly detection).  
- **Econometric** and **stochastic frontier analysis** projects for productivity growth, performance analytics and net zero.  
- **Mathematical modelling notebooks** from my academic research.  
- Clean, reproducible examples bridging engineering and AI.

Always happy to collaborate in building systems that merge academic rigour with industrial practicality - models that not only work on paper, but also transform real processes on the ground.
